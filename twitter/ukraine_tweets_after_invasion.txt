Then "China" doesn't exist &amp; had no sovereignty. CCP warmongers greenlit the invasion of Ukraine.

The US must arm Taiwan to keep "China" from doing to them what Russia did to Ukraine. https://t.co/a4WT2q0lvS@BorisJohnson @ZelenskyyUa You do know that when Ukraine join the EU, there’ll be a huge rebuilding and infrastructure budget allocated from the EU budget, and not one UK company will get a sniff of this work.
