Project Idea and Signifigance
-----
Information is more available to the average person today than ever in history. With this we have been able to help countless people avoid disaster with fast and reliable dissemination of information. However, recently this easy access to information has brought about a new issue, the spread of misinformation, commonly referred to as fake news. Fake news is mostly categorised as false or sensational stories spread to undermine or discredit a politician, organisation, or cause. The spread of fake news has become a major issue in recent years, especially in the United States, especially fake news surrounding politics and international conflicts. With this in mind, we propose a project analysing the spread of, and frequency of fake news posts on twitter. Our project will look at fake news trends on twitter from before and during the Russia - Ukraine war. This war has caused a great deal of political controversy worldwide, and in particular in the United States. Due to this we believe that the Russia - Ukraine war will have an impact on the frequency of fake news on twitter. Two factors that we will be considering are the timeline of the war as well as the sanctions that have been placed on Russia. In particular we will be looking at the trends of fake news relating to Twitter being banned in Russia. We will analyse fake news trends from before and after the war as well as from before and after the Twitter bans. We hypothesise that the Russia - Ukraine war will have led to an increase in the amount of fake news being spread on Twitter, and that the Twitter ban in Russia will have led to a decrease in the amount of fake news. The understanding of the source and propagation of fake news is important in combating the spread of fake news. We believe that by understanding how war and sanctions affect the creation and spread of fake news we will be able to better reduce fake news on social media and other platforms in the future.
